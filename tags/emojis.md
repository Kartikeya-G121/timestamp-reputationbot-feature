### What are those emojis and what do they mean?

Those emojis indicate what the bot does with a message:  

- 👀 ➜ Found a thankword
- 💤 ➜ Receiver was on cooldown
- 🔍 ➜ No receiver was found
- ❓ ➜ Receiver has no recent messages in this channel and is missing in the context
- ❔ ➜ Donor is not present in channel
- 🕛 ➜ The referenced message is too old
- 🗨️ ➜ User was prompted for reputation.

A bot admin can disable these emojis in the `repsettings`.
