### How can I request deletion of my data?

You have to be on a server with the Reputation Bot. If you don't have one, join the support server.

You can request deletion of your data with the `gdpr delete` command.

Once you have submitted your request your data will be deleted within a few hours. You will not receive a confirmation
of the deletion. You can not abort the deletion of your data.  
You may request your data again after some time, if you want to check that your data was deleted.

We will delete all your received reputation on all servers.  
We will remove your user id on every given reputation by you, but we will not delete these reputations, since they don't
belong to you.
