### How can I request my data?

You have to be on a server with the Reputation Bot. If you don't have one, join the support server. Make also sure 
that your privacy settings are not blocking dms.

You can request a copy of your data with the `gdpr request` command.

You will receive a copy of all data as a json file. This file will contain all entries which are related with your user
id. User ids of other users are removed and will not be included in your data.

You will receive the data within a few hours.  
You can request your data every 30 days.
