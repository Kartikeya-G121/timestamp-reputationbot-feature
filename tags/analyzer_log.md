### Why did user XY not receive any reputation or why was the message ignored?

This can have a lot of reasons and since it is nearly impossible for us to cover all the reasons here, we added 
a command which can tell exactly this. The `analyzer log <message_id>` command will show you in detail how the 
bot processed a message.

This command is basically showing what the debug emojis are showing as well, but will actually explain why 
something happened or not happened.
